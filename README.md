Dude, where's my alpha?

## Abstract

Have you ever wondered how "quants" turn data into money using cutting-edge
machine learning techniques? Even after five years at quant-based hedge funds, 
the speaker often wonders the same thing. In this talk the basic facts of
evaluating trading strategies are presented, focusing on Sharpe ratio, the
diversification benefit, achievable values of Sharpe, drawdowns, and,
time-permitting, connections between Hotelling's statistic and Markowitz
portfolio optimization. For those interested in careers in quantitative
finance, the conclusion is that while knowing statistics can't hurt, it's
better to be lucky than be good.

## Speaker

Steven Pav is a Quantitative Strategist at Cerebellum Capital, LLC. He holds a
PhD in mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University, and formerly was a Visiting
Assistant Professor at University of California, San Diego.
